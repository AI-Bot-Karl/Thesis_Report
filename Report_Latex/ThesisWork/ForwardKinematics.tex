\section{Forward Kinematics}

To model the movements of the end effector of a kinematic chain, a forward kinematic analysis is needed. 
%This means, that the position of the endpoint in the operational space needs to be described by the kinematic equations with the joint space as input. The non-linear kinematic equations map the joint parameters to the configuration of the robot system.   This results in a pure geometrical description of motion  by means of position, orientation, and their time derivatives. %Glossary
