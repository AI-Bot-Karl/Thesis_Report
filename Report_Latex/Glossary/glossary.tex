\newglossaryentry{numSol}{
	name={Numerical Solution},
	description={Originally the term numerical solution describes a solution given in terms of numbers instead of an explicit closed form expression. In this work, the term "numerical solution" refers to numerical, iterative methods for solving the inverse kinematics problem by using a sequence of steps leading to incrementally better solutions for the joint angles. Examples for these methdods are the jacobian inversion method, the optimization based method cyclic coordinate descent as shown by Lukas Barinka \cite{InvkinMeth_Lukas}.

\newglossaryentry{forwKin}{name={forward kinematics},description={Forward kinematics describes the position of the endpoint of a kinematic chain in the operational space by the kinematic equations with the joint variables as input. The non-linear kinematic equations map the joint parameters to the configuration of the robot system. This results in a pure geometrical description of motion by means of position, orientation, and their time derivatives.}}

\newglossaryentry{joints}{name={joint},description={A joint is a connection between two links that allows for movement within certain contstraints. }}

\newglossaryentry{link}{name={link},description={A link is a rigid body, defining the
		spatial relationship between two following axes. Links can be rotated or translated by joints, but don't deform themselves.}}
