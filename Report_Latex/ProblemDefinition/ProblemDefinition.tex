\chapter{Problem Definition}

For \ac{FRC} part production, a robot arm can be used to load the press with raw material, as it allows for more flexibility in the production line.
As the robot arm has many degrees of freedom, there are different strategies for a control cycle. 
Main constraint is to achieve this movement of materials as fast as possible to minimize the cool-down of the molten \ac{FRC}. 
Additionally, the accelerations and forces on the material should be minimized while transferring, to make sure no material is lost in the process.
This makes hit hard to find an ideal, fast control strategy to place the raw material into the press.
