%In chapter 3, I would enhance the first picture with something so you can connect it to the descriptions in the text below. I know the position of the delta robot, other eaders of your report may not. Maybe you should switch figures 3.1 and 3.2?​
%What is the point of elaborating 5 oven zones for your thesis?? Are you designing a control strategy that includes the heating of the oven?​
%​
%What is "Root arm task 2"? Surely you mean roBot arm?​
%​
%Chapter 3.5 set up process robot arm​
%What was YOUR role, what did you provide made did to realise all what has been realised? Same Q for commissioning chapter.​

%Determining the model

%Subsubchapter 4.1.2.3 Establishing DH parameters on the Fanuc 210F​
%​
%"A great help to determine these values is fig 4.4. This technical drawing was obtained from the data-sheet for​
%all Fanuc R-2000iB series robots. With this drawing, following DH-parameters can be obtained:​
%a1= 312 [mm]​
%a2= 1075 [mm]​
%a3= 225 [mm]​
%d4= 1280 [mm]​
%d6= 235 [mm]"​
%​
%Figure 4 helps in determining the ... values. No emphasis needed, keep this section short as it is basic stuff before you move on to the real stuff.​
%​
%Too many figures to explain the essence: you need some basic parameters and that's it.  describe this analysis in 2-3 pages. Get to the essence!!​

%What is EOAT? I can find it in the abbreviations but I do not recall an explanantion as to what it is and why you need it.
