%% definition/clickbait
Robots can be defined as programmable movement automatons that can perform tasks without human supervision and can be taught at least repetitive tasks. Increasingly, also ways to sense their surroundings are added and improve their movements according to their surroundings. These additionally to the sensors like pulse encoders at their axes to feedback control their endpoint position accuracy. 
%system supervision - robotic system - 
% A robot is defined as a programmable movement automaton, with the ability to perform tasks without human supervision. Not only can the robot be taught repetitive tasks, that it can execute with pulse encoders at their axes. it can as well sense its surroundings and on the basis of that information improve movements accordingly. 
% go to old from new! Go from general to specific Don't jump from general to specific to examples, don't mix it because reader has then to do all the work. and show that you are not only able to understand concepts, but are able to 1) present them in a coherent way and (later) critique them. chronology

%% simple robots
I have started working with robots and robotic systems in my bachelor studies. As a starting engineer, I was exploring the possibilities of automated manufacturing with CNC mills and 3D printers. These were very simplistic robotic systems based on a feedforward control with stepper motors for position accuracy. For starting a production process, these devices had to be half automatically calibrated and the position and orientation needed to be taught automatically by pointing the drill/printing head to the markerpoints.
