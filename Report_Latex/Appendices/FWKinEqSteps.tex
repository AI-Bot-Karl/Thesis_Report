\chapter{Intermediate Steps in Forming Forward Kinematic Equations} \label{sec:FWKinEqSteps}
The complete transformation matrix can be found with:

\input{ThesisWork/ForwardKinematics/TransformationMatrix1}

This set of matrices can be filled with the numerical values from \fullref{table:DH-Parameter_num}

\input{ThesisWork/ForwardKinematics/TransformationMatrix_numVal}

With some simplification this results in the following equation:
