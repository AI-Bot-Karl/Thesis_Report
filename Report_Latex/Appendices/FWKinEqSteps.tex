The complete transformation matrix can be found with:

\input{ThesisWork/ForwardKinematics/TransformationMatrix1}

%This set of matrices can be filled with the numerical values from \fullref{table:DH-Parameter_num}
%
%\input{ThesisWork/ForwardKinematics/TransformationMatrix_numVal}

With some simplification this results in the following set of equations:

%\input{ThesisWork/ForwardKinematics/TransformationMatrix_numVal_simplified}

\input{ThesisWork/ForwardKinematics/ForwKinEqu}

These can be expressed in short as:
